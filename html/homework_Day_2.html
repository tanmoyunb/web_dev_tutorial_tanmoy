                                                                            When I saw a metalot old and grey.
                                                                         He was carrying his kitbag and his hammock 
                                                                             And as he passed I heard him say,
                  
                                                                                "Oh I wonder, yes i wonder

                                                                             For I've been a barrack stanchion
                                                                                 In good old Jago's Mansions
                                                                                And I don't want to go to sea!"
